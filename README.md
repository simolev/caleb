Jewish dates conversion tool

### Disclaimer:
**a)** It is not accurate for dates before Gregorian **1582-10-15**. In the Gregorian calendar, there are 10 missing days between 1582-10-15 and 1582-10-04. Those days never occurred, but nonetheless they seem to exist in go's implementation, and the only solution I see at the moment would be to add manual correction to the algorithm.

**b)** This is quite new and would require more thorough testing before being relied upon.

**c)** Code could be more idiomatic and optimized.
